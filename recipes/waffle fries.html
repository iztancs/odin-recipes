		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			These homemade waffle fries are crispy and beautifully on the outside, but
			perfectly soft and fluffy on the inside.
		</p>
		<p>
			Make this homemade waffle fry recipe with just three ingredients: russet
			potatoes (peeled), peanut or vegetable oil (for frying), and salt. You can
			use seasoned salt for extra bold flavor.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>

		<h4>Waffle Fries</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
			<li>peanut or vegetable oil for frying</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon salt or desired seasoning</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Zippy Fry Sauce</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon dill pickle brine (from a jar of pickles)</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon Sriracha sauce or bottled chipotle hot sauce</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (400 degrees C).
				Set two wire racks atop paper towels.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fill a large bowl with ice water. Using a mandoline with a waffle blade
				set to 1/4-inch, slice potatoes crosswise, then rotate 90Â° and make
				another slice for each waffle fry (you can also use a crinkle cutter
				using the same process).
			</li>
			<li>Add cut waffle fries to the ice water as they are done.</li>
			<li>
				In a large heavy saucepan, add 2 inches of oil. Clip a candy/oil
				thermometer to the side of the pan. Heat oil over medium heat to 310
				degrees F (155 degrees C).
			</li>
			<li>Drain waffle fries and blot dry with paper towels.</li>
			<li>
				Working in batches, fry waffle fries 4 to 5 minutes. They should just
				cook through at this point, but not brown.
			</li>
			<li>Remove from oil with a slotted spoon and place on wire racks.</li>
			<li>
				Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Add waffle
				fries in batches and cook 1 to 2 minutes until golden brown.
			</li>
			<li>
				Drain on paper towels, and sprinkle with salt. Transfer cooked fries to
				the oven to keep warm while frying remaining waffle fries.
			</li>
			<li>Serve with Zippy Fry Sauce.</li>
